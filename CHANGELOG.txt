- Added Screen on action
- Added actions for switching media tracks (prev/next)
- Added double-sweep support
--- now allows up to 10 actions (2*5)
--- Things to be aware of:
------ double-swipe introduces 1 second delay to single swipe (only when set) which is a time window
------ during which module waits for user to repeat swipe 
------ double-swiping too fast triggers doubletap
------ requires some practice
